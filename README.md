This is my portfolio website made with React and three.js.  All models are handmade in Blender.

# Challenges
The biggest challenge was designing this website to be viewable on desktop and mobile.  Given that I'm working with a 3D scene, the possibilities were endless, and I could try a few different things.  I decided to use a mix of displaying text content in the 3D scene and having an HTML overlay displaying the meat and bones of my portfolio.  Overall, I think it's a great mix, and suits the scene well.  Enjoy!
